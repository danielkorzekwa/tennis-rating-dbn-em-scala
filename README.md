### Tennis Ratings based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Expectation Maximization, implemented in Scala.

Please refer to https://github.com/danielkorzekwa/tennis-rating-dbn-em-scala/tree/master/doc for more details.

For the expectation step of EM algorithm I use:
 * My implementation of Belief Propagation on a cluster graph, as presented at the 
   Probabilistic Graphical Models course (https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm), Spring term 2012.
 * Mallet GRMM toolbox created by Sutton, Charles.  "GRMM: GRaphical Models in Mallet." http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/grmm/. 2006.
